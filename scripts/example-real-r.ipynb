    "Does college pay off? We'll use some of the latest data from the US Department of Education's <a href=\"https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/\">College Scorecard Database</a> to answer that question. In this first notebook, you'll get a gentle introduction to R - a coding language used by data scientists to analyze large datasets. Then, you'll begin diving into the college scorecard data yourself. By the end of this notebook, you'll get a general sense of which colleges set up their graduates for success and which colleges ... don't."

    "When analyzing variables of interest, it's often helpful to calculate summary statistics. For quantitative variables, we can use the `summary` command to find the five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum) and the average (mean) of the values. The code block shows how we find these summary statistics for the `admit_rate` variable. Note: the `$` sign in R is used to isolate a single variable (`admit_rate`) from a dataframe (`dat`)."

    "A few interesting facts about `admit_rate` that are revealed by this summary:\n",
    "- As expected, no institutions have a 0% admissions rate (the minimum admissions rate is 2.4%). If a school had a 0% admissions rate, they wouldn't have any students! However, interestingly, the maximum admissions rate was 100%. So, there's at least one institution that has a 100% admissions rate, meaning they admit every single student who applies.\n",
    "- The first quartile (Q1) is a 59.79% admissions rate. This means that 75% of institutions have admissions rates of about 60% or higher. **Only 25% of institutions** have admissions rates of 60% or lower. The average (mean) admissions rate is a fairly high 70.81%. This emphasizes how some of the very selectives schools with admissions rates under 10% - such as Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Swarthmore, and Juilliard - are unusual compared to most institutions in the dataset.\n",
    "- For 2,731 schools, we have missing data. R uses the sybmol `NA` to represent missing values. If we use `admit_rate` in future analyses, we should pay attention to which schools have missing data and, ideally, investigate why their data is missing."
