## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Setup a development environment using [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/dev/). Pixi is a package management tool for developers. It allows the developer to install libraries and applications in a reproducible way. Use pixi cross-platform, on Windows, Mac and Linux.

To install pixi you can run the following command in your terminal:

**Linux and MacOS**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows**:

```powershell
# PowerShell
iwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Make a copy of the `.envrc.example` file and rename it to `.envrc`. These variables are used to configure the environment.
4. Create a file at `.aws-secrets/jupyter-s3.json` with the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "access_key": "FAKE_JUPYTER_ACCESS_KEY",
     "secret_key": "FAKE_JUPYTER_SECRET_KEY",
     "url": "FAKE_JUPYTER_SECRET_KEY"
   }
   ```

5. Install and build with Pixi: `pixi run build`.

This will install the following dependencies before building the application:

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Java 17+](https://openjdk.org)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
- [`direnv`](https://direnv.net)
- [`awslocal`](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local)

## Activate the Environment

Every time you start a new terminal session, you need to initialize the environment. This is done by running the following two command in the project root directory:

```bash
# activate the virtual environment
pixi shell

# load the environment variables
direnv allow
```

## Run the Application

Use the pre-configured Pixi `tasks` to run the application. The following tasks are available:

- `pixi run build`: Build the application. This will initialize LocalStack, ensure Gradle dependencies are installed, and then build the application.
- `pixi run start`: Start the application. This will use Docker Compose to start the PostgreSQL database and then start the Spring Boot application.
  - `pixi run start-services`: Start the database and other services. This will start the PostgreSQL database and other services needed for the application, but will **not** start the Spring Boot application. After running this task, you can start the Spring Boot application with `./start.sh`.
  - `pixi run start:watch` & `pixi run start-services:watch`: Start the application and services in non-detached mode. These variants will start the application and services in the foreground, allowing you to see the logs in real-time.
- `pixi run stop`: Stop the application. This will stop the PostgreSQL database and the Spring Boot application.

## Database

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PostgreSQL must be fully initialized before starting the Spring Boot application. The Pixi scripts utilize Docker Compose to manage the PostgreSQL database, and Docker Compose ensures that the database is fully initialized (via health checks) before starting the API container.

### Connection

To connect to the local database using a terminal command or IDE, you can use the following credentials:

```sql
DATABASE=ckhubapi
PORT=5433
USERNAME=ckhub
PASSWORD=ckhub
```

### Migrations

Flyway is integrated to manage database migrations, ensuring that the database schema is always up-to-date with the application's codebase.

### Flyway Configuration

Flyway is already configured in the project. Migration scripts are located in `src/main/resources/db/migration`. Ensure that all migrations are correctly versioned and applied.

### Adding Necessary Extensions

Some migrations require specific PostgreSQL extensions. For example, to use `uuid_generate_v4()`, the `uuid-ossp` extension must be created in the database. This is handled within Flyway migration scripts.

## Testing and Coverage

The project uses JUnit 5 for testing and Jacoco for coverage. To run the tests and generate a coverage report, use the following commands (make sure you have activated the Pixi environment with `pixi shell`):

**Test**:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

**Coverage**:

```bash
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```
