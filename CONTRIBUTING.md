# Contributing Guide

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Install the following applications:

- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/dev/): for package management
- [`direnv`](https://direnv.net): for environment variable management

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Make a copy of the `.envrc.example` file and rename it to `.envrc`. These variables are used to configure the environment.
4. Run `pixi shell` to install the project dependencies and activate the environment.
   - [Java 17+](https://openjdk.org)
   - [Gradle](https://gradle.org)
   - [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
   - [`awslocal`](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local)
5. Run `direnv allow` to allow the environment variables to be loaded into the shell session. **This must be done _after_ running `pixi shell`**.
6. Create a file at `.aws-secrets/jupyter-s3.json` with the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "access_key": "FAKE_JUPYTER_ACCESS_KEY",
     "secret_key": "FAKE_JUPYTER_SECRET_KEY",
     "url": "FAKE_JUPYTER_SECRET_KEY"
   }
   ```

7. Install and build the application with Pixi: `pixi run build`.

## Run the Application

Use the pre-configured Pixi `tasks` to run the application. Using these tasks ensures that the environment is properly configured with the needed dependencies and that the application is started correctly.

The following tasks are available:

- `pixi run build`: Build the application. This will initialize LocalStack, ensure Gradle dependencies are installed, and then build the application.
- `pixi run start`: Start the application. This will use Docker Compose to start the PostgreSQL database and then start the Spring Boot application.
  - `pixi run start-services`: Start the database and other services. This will start the PostgreSQL database and other services needed for the application, but will **not** start the Spring Boot application. After running this task, you can start the Spring Boot application with `./start.sh`.
- `pixi run stop`: Stop the application. This will stop the PostgreSQL database and the Spring Boot application.
- `pixi run test`: Run the tests. This will run the unit tests and integration tests.
- `pixi run coverage`: Run the tests and generate a coverage report. This will run the tests and generate a coverage report in the `build/reports/jacoco/test/html` directory.
- `pixi run clean`: Clean the project. This will remove the build artifacts and other temporary files.

### Activating the Environment

If you are doing something other than using the Pixi commands you need to ensure that your environment is properly activated with `pixi shell`. Every time you start a new terminal session, you need to initialize the environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always sure you have the Pixi environment activated before running any commands. If you ever run `direnv allow` or `direnv reload` without the Pixi environment activated, you will need to run `direnv reload` to reload the environment variables after you activate the Pixi environment with `pixi shell`.

## Database

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PostgreSQL must be fully initialized before starting the Spring Boot application. The Pixi scripts utilize Docker Compose to manage the PostgreSQL database, and Docker Compose ensures that the database is fully initialized (via health checks) before starting the API container.

### Connection

To connect to the local database using a terminal command or IDE, you can use the following credentials:

```sql
DATABASE=ckhubapi
PORT=5433
USERNAME=ckhub
PASSWORD=ckhub
```

### Migrations

Flyway is integrated to manage database migrations, ensuring that the database schema is always up-to-date with the application's codebase.

### Flyway Configuration

Flyway is already configured in the project. Migration scripts are located in `src/main/resources/db/migration`. Ensure that all migrations are correctly versioned and applied.

### Adding Necessary Extensions

Some migrations require specific PostgreSQL extensions. For example, to use `uuid_generate_v4()`, the `uuid-ossp` extension must be created in the database. This is handled within Flyway migration scripts.
