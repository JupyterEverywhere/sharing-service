# Jupyter Everywhere Sharing Service

The sharing service is the back-end of the Jupyter Everywhere project. It is a RESTful API that allows users to store, retrieve, and share Jupyter Notebooks. The service is designed to be scalable and reliable, utilizing cloud-based storage solutions to ensure that users can access their notebooks from anywhere.

The API enhances workflows by validating notebook formatting, preventing duplication, and storing them anonymously, making it easier to integrate with other services without requiring user enrollment associations.

## API Documentation

You can have a description of the API in the official Postman Workspace. Request permissions to access here:
